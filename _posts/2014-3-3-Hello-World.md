This is my first ever blog! I've been writing in a growth journal for a year now, and I am hoping that this experience will help me grow even more! I am excited to start writing publically and share my experiences about life and coding.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
